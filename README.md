# About this Repo

This repository is designed to help developers grow from Junior to Intermediate levels through small, playful projects. The focus is on hands-on learning through mini-projects, problem-solving, trying out new coding techniques, and developing simple games or utilities. No complex or large-scale projects are included hereâ€”just practical exercises to improve your coding skills step by step.
